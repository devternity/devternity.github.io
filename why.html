              <p>In just two days, you will learn much more than your competitors, who attend narrow-focused conferences.

The grounds are packaged in steel canisters and pressurized with an inert gas rather than air. DevTernity runs on Illy. And, like all best things in life, it's free.</p>

              <p>Do you know what's the real purpose of any vendor, technology or a language specific conference? Think of Kubernetes, Docker, Amazon... It's to make you dependent on the vendor for products and services, so you can't use another vendor without substantial switching costs. It's called "vendor lock-in". Here at DevTernity, you will get unbiased view on technology, trends and solutions. No sales. No hidden messages. Ever.</p>
