All too often the focus of what is often described as architecture is centred around a specific set of platform technologies, which forms only one part of the set of concerns an architecture should. And all too often architecture is seen as a separate concern from development process, whereas the two are intertwined — what you build is influenced by how you build it, and vice versa. </p><p>This course looks at the relationship between Agile processes and good architecture, taking in development process models, architectural styles, requirements techniques, sufficient modelling techniques, design patterns and testing practices. This course includes a number of practical exercises so that attendees can see how the different activities fit together.</p>",

In the real world the main activity of any significant clean-up is throwing out and reducing. The less code you have, the less you will have to optimise, to secure, to debug, to rework, etc.; the more of a codebase you will be able to fit in your head and understand and reason about. What can you remove? Dead code, speculative generalisations and needless abstractions. What can you reduce? Accidental complexity, verbosity and first-draft thinking now that we know better.

            "description": "Many codebases contain code that is overly complicated, hard to understand, and hence expensive to change and evolve. Prioritizing technical debt is a hard problem as modern systems might have millions of lines of code and multiple development teams -- no-one has a holistic overview. In addition, there's always a trade-off between improving existing code versus adding new features so we need to use our time wisely. So what if we could mine the collective intelligence of all contributing programmers, and start to make decisions based on information from how the organization actually works with the code? In this presentation you'll see how easily obtained version-control data let us uncover the behavior and patterns of the development organization. This language-neutral approach lets you prioritize the parts of your system that benefit the most from improvements, so that you can balance short- and long-term goals guided by data. The specific examples are from real-world codebases like Android, the Linux Kernel, .Net Core Runtime, and more. This new perspective on software development will change how you view code.",

Nowadays developers split even more into front-end/back-end/Android/iOS/whatever else. This leads to inflated teams, inefficient communication, lack of each developer's responsibility, low team's truck factor, and inability to solve production/design problems once and for all instead of applying patches here and there. The term \"full-stack\" is often applied to developers being responsible for all aspects of their work, but XP/craftsmanship practices go further — we should also take our communication, requirements, operations, testing, etc. under control. True сraftsmen can be an order of magnitude more efficient than narrowly skilled developers. They not only write code, but solve problems. Surely you want to be one. Let's break it down and see why it works.",

There are four sections to this talk: - What's an index? * How to create an index? * Understanding the execution plan * Common pitfalls What's an index In the first part we will learn what an index actually is. And we're talking data structures. How is an index actually represented internally and what are the implications of that. This is important because it makes certain characteristics of indexes much easier to understand. ",

            "description": "Long time ago there was a role of a business analyst, who would discover and gather client requirements, then together with a system analysts, write them down. Next, they would meet an architect, where they would analyze the impact of those requirements on the architecture, and impact of architecture on business opportunities. This collaboration would provide new ideas for the business, but most of all, would create the analysis that went to developers. Then there were eXtreme Programming (XP). Then came Scrum and Kanban with Scrum Masters and Product Owners. Neither of them had any experience with XP, but since they loathed the old world, they have fired all the system and business analysts. And so, two working methods of requirement analysis were replaced by a single ineffective meeting called “grooming”, where a seven plus/minus three people, without any preparation, try to estimate something that nobody took time to understand. I’d like to show you how we came to this point, why the current situation puts developers in jail, and how to solve this madness."

With all those methodologies and technologies we should be highly effective, right? Probably not. Most of us still struggle with balancing coding speed and quality, working on the stuff that really makes a difference, and feeling constantly stressed by all the things we should learn. Effective developers don't just write clean, simple, and robust code. They also have a strong understanding of the entire development process and the problem that needs to be solved. They take time to learn, practice, and play. Learn how those developers build effective coding habits, use automations whenever needed, reserve time for deep work, and much more. You’ll walk away from this talk with lots of ideas on how to work smarter, not harder.",

Well supposedly it will. And how much is it going to cost? Not that much, especially if we’re not the ones paying the bills.
