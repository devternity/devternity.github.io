All too often the focus of what is often described as architecture is centred around a specific set of platform technologies, which forms only one part of the set of concerns an architecture should. And all too often architecture is seen as a separate concern from development process, whereas the two are intertwined — what you build is influenced by how you build it, and vice versa. </p><p>This workshop looks at the relationship between Agile processes and good architecture, taking in development process models, architectural styles, requirements techniques, sufficient modelling techniques, design patterns and testing practices. This workshop includes a number of practical exercises so that attendees can see how the different activities fit together.</p><p>Note: this workshop runs from 9:00 until 16:00.</p>",

          "description": "Developers and IT people in general tend to specialize and become narrowly skilled. In the past there was always the conflict of DB developers vs application developers, or DBA vs developers vs testers. Nowadays developers split even more into front-end/back-end/Android/iOS/whatever else. This leads to inflated teams, inefficient communication, lack of each developer's responsibility, low team's truck factor, and inability to solve production/design problems once and for all instead of applying patches here and there. The term \"full-stack\" is often applied to developers being responsible for all aspects of their work, but XP/craftsmanship practices go further — we should also take our communication, requirements, operations, testing, etc. under control. True сraftsmen can be an order of magnitude more efficient than narrowly skilled developers. They not only write code, but solve problems. Surely you want to be one. Let's break it down and see why it works.",

Effective developers don't just write clean, simple, and robust code. They also have a strong understanding of the entire development process and the problem that needs to be solved. They take time to learn, practice, and play. Learn how those developers build effective coding habits, use automations whenever needed, reserve time for deep work, and much more.
