It matters that we feel the fear now and need to deal with it. Rewrite or refactor? How do we write tests? There’s so much to change; how do we get started? In the typical programmer’s day job, there’s no time to learn how to do this. We’re already behind schedule and the cost of fixing the legacy code is crushing us. We need a way to learn how to do this safely, correctly, and eventually, even quickly. You'll learn: <ul class=\"fa-ul\"><li><span class=\"fa-li\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-square\"></i></span>When to refactor and when to rewrite, and how to do that safely.</li><li><span class=\"fa-li\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-square\"></i></span>The killer technique for exposing in glorious detail exactly where the code wants us to break it apart.</li><li><span class=\"fa-li\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-square\"></i></span>How to use statistical sampling and logs to cobble together the beginnings of a test suite.</li><li><span class=\"fa-li\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-square\"></i></span>How to sterilise a legacy environment before even trying to change the code.</li><li><span class=\"fa-li\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-square\"></i></span>How to crack the chicken-and-egg problem: I need to write tests in order to refactor, and I need to refactor in order to write tests.</li></ul></p><p>We will work in short sessions on a diabolical-but-fun code base (available in at least 20 programming languages), practise micro-committing, a key technique to changing difficult code safely, practise a handful of refactoring and testing exercises that <b>develop the most essential legacy code rescue skills and disciplines.</b><p>Note: this workshop runs from 13:00 until 19:00.</p>",

All too often the focus of what is often described as architecture is centred around a specific set of platform technologies, which forms only one part of the set of concerns an architecture should. And all too often architecture is seen as a separate concern from development process, whereas the two are intertwined — what you build is influenced by how you build it, and vice versa. <p>This workshop looks at the relationship between Agile processes and good architecture, taking in development process models, architectural styles, requirements techniques, sufficient modelling techniques, design patterns and testing practices. This workshop includes a number of practical exercises so that attendees can see how the different activities fit together.</p><p>Note: this workshop runs from 9:00 until 16:00.</p>",

You don’t do that with rigid rules, processes, and tools imposed by management.

Some developers do not consider their unit tests to be proper code, because unit tests are not shipped with the software. On the other hand, many developers do not consider configuration to be code, even though it is shipped with the software, defines how the software executes and is written in a formal notation. And imagine deploying a system with millions and millions of configuration parameters that none of the developers understood or knew how to test properly? Imagine machine learning. This talk is a journey into code, a journey into testing, a journey into quality and a journey into keeping software soft. There's no need to make it harder than it already is.",

It never seems to get easier, it never seems to go faster, and so it always seems safer to rip things apart and write them again. If you or someone you know feels stuck like this, then let's talk about why that happens and what to do about it. I'm pretty sure that will also provide a nice starting point for larger discussions about our work as programmers, how evolutionary design (TDD, refactoring) fits in, and anything else that we feel vaguely interested in talking about. My brain will be open.",

          "description": "In this talk we'll explain the basics of functional programming, where it fits in with the Object Orientation paradigm and how we can use functional programming in our every day work. We’ll cover important concepts functional programming such as: Lambdas, Higher Order Functions, Partial Functions, Monads and more, and see how we can apply these in a series of functional patterns to cut down our codebase and at the same time make sure we keep it maintainable.",

Always? \"Don’t Mock in your tests\" vs \"Mock everything\" - so which one do I choose? \"100% code coverage is a must\" - really? Why? And the list goes on… In this presentation we are going to talk about popular beliefs in the testing world. We will see  slides and live coding examples. Both juniors and seniors should find something useful in it.",

          "description": "A few years ago, the death of agile was a meme. Agile was (and is still) being supplanted by 'Dark Agile', an Agile in name only, with few of the benefits of the real thing. In a way, things have gotten worse. Agile has arisen as a zombie, eating the brains of the corporate world. 'Dark Agile' flies in the face of basic principles, and does active damage. All is not lost, though. There are organizations, some quite large, that are 'doing it right', and reaping the benefits. We haven't fallen completely into Orwellian dysfunction. This talk shows you what Agile should be and contrasts that to what it has become. We’ll look at the ways that it’s been perverted",

In this talk, I’ll share a few candid stories of my career failures… I mean… learning opportunities. We’ll start by debunking the myth that leadership == management. Next, we’ll talk about some the attributes, behaviors and skills of good leaders. Last, we’ll cover some practical steps and resources to accelerate your journey. You’ll walk away with some essential leadership skills I believe anyone can develop, and a good dose of encouragement to be more awesome!",
