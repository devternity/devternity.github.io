It matters that we feel the fear now and need to deal with it. Rewrite or refactor? How do we write tests? There’s so much to change; how do we get started? In the typical programmer’s day job, there’s no time to learn how to do this. We’re already behind schedule and the cost of fixing the legacy code is crushing us. We need a way to learn how to do this safely, correctly, and eventually, even quickly. You'll learn: <ul class=\"fa-ul\"><li><span class=\"fa-li\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-square\"></i></span>When to refactor and when to rewrite, and how to do that safely.</li><li><span class=\"fa-li\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-square\"></i></span>The killer technique for exposing in glorious detail exactly where the code wants us to break it apart.</li><li><span class=\"fa-li\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-square\"></i></span>How to use statistical sampling and logs to cobble together the beginnings of a test suite.</li><li><span class=\"fa-li\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-square\"></i></span>How to sterilise a legacy environment before even trying to change the code.</li><li><span class=\"fa-li\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-square\"></i></span>How to crack the chicken-and-egg problem: I need to write tests in order to refactor, and I need to refactor in order to write tests.</li></ul></p><p>We will work in short sessions on a diabolical-but-fun code base (available in at least 20 programming languages), practise micro-committing, a key technique to changing difficult code safely, practise a handful of refactoring and testing exercises that <b>develop the most essential legacy code rescue skills and disciplines.</b><p>Note: this workshop runs from 11:00 until 17:00.</p>",

            "brief_description": "Every system has an architecture, whether accidental or intentional, and regardless of whether it was put in place by a nominated architect or whether it emerged from the decisions and discussions of a team. All too often the focus of what is often described as architecture is centred around a specific set of platform technologies, which forms only one part of the set of concerns an architecture should. And all too often architecture is seen as a separate concern from development process, whereas the two are intertwined — what you build is influenced by how you build it, and vice versa. The course covers a wide range of topics through a number of practical exercises, with plenty of time dedicated to group discussion:</p><ul class=\"awsm\"><li>The relationship between development process and architecture<li>The roles and failure modes of testing, modelling and technology platforms<li>Different architectural styles and design patterns<li>How to transform product vision into architecture<li>Future-proofing your architecture, and accounting for uncertainty<li>How to ground your architecture and avoid overdesign<li>...and much more!</li></ul><p>Note: this workshop runs from 9:00 until 16:00.</p>",

Some developers do not consider their unit tests to be proper code, because unit tests are not shipped with the software. On the other hand, many developers do not consider configuration to be code, even though it is shipped with the software, defines how the software executes and is written in a formal notation. And imagine deploying a system with millions and millions of configuration parameters that none of the developers understood or knew how to test properly? Imagine machine learning. This talk is a journey into code, a journey into testing, a journey into quality and a journey into keeping software soft. There's no need to make it harder than it already is.",

            "description": "Statically typed functional programming languages encourage a very different way of thinking about types. The type system is your friend, not an annoyance, and can be used in many ways that might not be familiar to OO programmers. Types can be used to represent the domain in a fine-grained, self documenting way. And in many cases, types can even be used to encode business rules so that you literally cannot create incorrect code. You can then use the static type checking almost as an instant unit test — making sure that your code is correct at compile time. In this talk, we'll look at some of the ways you can use types as part of a domain driven design process, with some simple real world examples in F#. No jargon, no maths, and no prior F# experience necessary.",

But then nothing worked in production. Then came events! And nothing ever completed. In this talk we'll look at the problem from a holistic perspective - take the fundamental property of autonomy for any microservice-based architecture, and design how services should communicate so that they can still achieve their purpose in the world. We'll cover basic communication patterns, where we run into problems with them, and how advanced conversational patterns can help. Finally, we'll look at some real-world scenarios for designing complex coordination and where conversation patterns can retain our autonomy and loose coupling.",

            "description": "Many programmers get stuck when they try to learn evolutionary design, particularly the refactoring part of it. It never seems to get easier, it never seems to go faster, and so it always seems safer to rip things apart and write them again. If you or someone you know feels stuck like this, then let's talk about why that happens and what to do about it. I'm pretty sure that will also provide a nice starting point for larger discussions about our work as programmers, how evolutionary design (TDD, refactoring) fits in, and anything else that we feel vaguely interested in talking about. My brain will be open.",

            "description": "Microservices have been a popular architecture choice for at least 5 years by now. Over these years we've adopted microservices architectures to ever growing set of use-cases and different development and deployment strategies. Lessons were learned and our ability to design, develop, deploy and operate microservices has improved. This presentation will give an opinionated view of how microservices evolved in the last few years, based on experience gained while working with companies using Apache Kafka to update their application architecture. We'll discuss the rise of API gateways, service mesh, state management and serverless architectures - what works well, and in which cases. We'll show real-world examples of how applications become more resilient and scalable when new patterns are introduced, and make sure to include caveats - because patterns are all about using them in the right context.",
