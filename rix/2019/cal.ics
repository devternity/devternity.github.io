SUMMARY:Surviving Legacy Code (J.B. Rainsberger)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity 
DESCRIPTION:#evolutionary design #legacy code #clean code\n\nWHAT YOU’LL LEARN:\n * When to refactor and when to rewrite\, and how to do that safely.\n * The killer technique for exposing in glorious detail exactly where the code wants us to break it apart.\n * How to use statistical sampling and logs to cobble together the beginnings of a test suite.\n * How to sterilise a legacy environment before even trying to change the code.\n * How to crack the chicken-and-egg problem: I need to write tests in order to refactor\, and I need to refactor in order to write tests.\n\n\n\nWe will work in short sessions on a diabolical-but-fun code base (available in at least 20 programming languages)\, practise micro-committing\, a key technique to changing difficult code safely\, practise a handful of refactoring and testing exercises that develop the most essential legacy code rescue skills and disciplines.

SUMMARY:Software Architecture in a Post-agile World (Uwe Friedrichsen)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity 
DESCRIPTION:#software architecture\n\nWHAT'S INSIDE?\nIn this workshop we will first discuss the challenges of architectural work in a post-agile IT world. Then\, after rediscovering why we need architectural work at all\, we will set up a surprisingly simple down-to-earth approach for implementing it. After that\, we will fill the building blocks one by one. Finally\, we will complete the picture by discussing questions like: When should we do what? How much should we do in which context? How can we create a sustainable architecture and where are the limits? Plus some more topics. All this will happen in a mix of bits of theory\, lots of interaction and hands-on\, plus room for questions\, discussion\, tips\, tricks and more. After this workshop\, you will have a better understanding what architectural work actually is about\, what is important\, what is not\, and how to tackle it in practice.

SUMMARY:Lean Code (Kevlin Henney)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity 
DESCRIPTION:#general programming #coding #best practices\n\nLean has been applied as a toolkit to fine-tune development processes and organisational workflow\, but what does it mean when we apply the practices to the detail of the code\, the practices used to develop it and the people who develop it? What does Lean Code and its creation look like? There is a need to move beyond often separated worlds of software craft and agile development\, to properly embrace code in its detail\, but to also connect it more completely to the flow of business and the intelligence of people around it. To move beyond simple exhortations of clean code to something more human. This talk offers a fresh look at Lean principles and practices from the perspective of the code and the coder\, rather than the usual scale of the organisation and the development process.

SUMMARY:Vertical Slice Architecture (Jimmy Bogard)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#architecture #domain-driven design #.net examples\n\nMoving from a layered architecture to a vertical slice architecture can be a bit daunting. We remove abstractions\, complex structures\, and focus building on the axis of change\, then what's next? What new structures\, patterns\, and policies will need to be introduced in this style of architecture? How will we deal with common business functionality\, and where do concepts like CQRS and DDD fit in? In this session\, we'll introduce the idea of vertical slice architectures\, and dive into the patterns\, tools\, and techniques used with slices. We'll also cover how you can fit vertical slices into different kinds of systems\, from desktop\, SPA\, and normal MVC applications. Finally\, we'll look at some of the new challenges that come with slices and layers\, and how a different approach provides a much more maintainable end result.

SUMMARY:Achieving Technical Excellence in Your Software Teams (Peter Gfader)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#software craftsmanship #clean code #best practices\n\nOur industry has a problem: We are not lacking software methodologies\, programming languages\, tools or frameworks but we need great software engineers. Great software engineer teams build quality-in and deliver great software on a regular basis. The technical excellence of those engineers will help you escape the "Waterfall sandwich" and make your organization a little more agile\, from the inception of an idea till they go live. I will talk about my experiences from the last 15 years\, including small software delivery teams until big financial institutions. Why would a company like to be "agile"? How can a company achieve that? How can you achieve Technical Excellence in your software teams? What developer skills are more important than languages\, methods or frameworks? This will be an interactive session with a Q&A at the end.

SUMMARY:Feature Branching Considered Evil (Thierry de Pauw)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#continuous integration #continuous delivery\n\nWith DVCSs branch creation became very easy\, but it comes at a certain cost. Long living branches break the flow of the software delivery process\, impacting stability and throughput. The session explores why teams are using feature branches\, what problems are introduced by using them and what techniques exist to avoid them altogether. It explores exactly what's evil about feature branches\, which is not necessarily the problems they introduce - but rather\, the real reasons why teams are using them. After the session\, you'll understand a different branching strategy and how it relates to CI/CD.

SUMMARY:The Clean Architecture (Ian Cooper)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#architecture #.net examples\n\nWhat is the clean architecture and how you would build one in .NET? Recently Bob Martin has categorized a set of architectures\, including hexagonal architecture\, onion architecture and screaming architecture as 'the clean architecture' - a layered architecture of concentric circles with a strong emphasis on separation of concerns. This architecture has become popular because of its amenability to modification as an evolutionary architecture and its support for practices such as TDD. In this presentation we will discuss the clean architecture and its benefits. More than that\, in the bulk of the presentation\, we will show you how to implement a clean architecture in .NET. From first steps to working code\, we will show you the moves required to embrace this approach\, and introduce you to some of the OSS libraries that can help you get there. All examples will be in .NET Core

SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#oop #dependency injection #java\n\nMost developers don’t write Object-Oriented code\, including myself. And yet\, we have learned how to do it. Why is that? One of the possible reasons\, is that many frameworks (Java EE\, Spring) do not favor OOP in their design. But what is OOP really? We will have a look at a super-simplified bank account model. In my demo\, I’ll demo with a Java-based application how can we evolve from the traditional current approach to proper OOP. Finally\, it will be time to have a look at the benefits and drawbacks of both approach.

SUMMARY:Finding Your Service Boundaries – A Practical Guide (Adam Ralph)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#architecture #soa #microservices\n\nWe know it's useful to split up complex systems. We've seen the benefits of modular deployment of microservices. Dealing with only one piece of code at a time eases our cognitive load. But how do we know where to draw the service boundaries? In complex business domains\, it's often difficult to know where to start. When we get our boundaries wrong\, the clocks starts ticking. Before long\, we hear ourselves say "it would be easier to re-write it". Join Adam for practical advice on discovering the hidden boundaries in your systems. Help tease out the natural separation of concerns in a sample business domain. During 20 years of developing complex systems\, Adam has had plenty of time to get things wrong. Learn to avoid the common pitfalls that can lead us down the path to "the big re-write".

SUMMARY:DevOps is Not Enough – Re-thinking IT from Scratch (Uwe Friedrichsen)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#devops #IT performance #best practices\n\nDevOps - a simple term\, but tons of confusion. Some think\, it is about more collaboration between Dev and Ops. Others think\, it is just about tools and automation. But in its core\, DevOps is about accelerating the IT value chain. How long does it take to deliver a business idea to your customer using IT? How fast can you go - repeatedly and without compromising quality? But why should we speed up in the first place? Do we really need it? How fast is fast enough? How can we implement it? What else do we need to take into account? ... lots of questions if we follow this thought for a moment. In this session we will try to answer some of the questions. We will examine the drivers and goals behind DevOps and answer the question why we need to change. Then we will see how DevOps affects the way we think and act\, what else is needed to really "become DevOps" and how all these building blocks are connected to each other. Finally\, we will have a brief peek into the (likely) future of DevOps.

SUMMARY:The Jedi Techniques of Problem Solving (Maxim Dorofeev)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#productivity #getting things done #teamwork\n\nAn anthill is not a simple sum of ants. What matters most is an interaction between them. Taking into account that people are extremely more complicated creature than ants it is possible to assume that making every team member productive definitely will not give us a productive team as a whole. The fundamental feature of any productive team is the ability to collaborative problem-solving. The most common reason for a problem to occur is that too often we see the same thing in different ways (typically all of us are wrong) and at the same time\, we can poorly express our thought. I’m going to share with you some simple and useful tools that could help us better understand each other and to find better solutions for the problems we face.

SUMMARY:The Well-Balanced Programmer (J.B. Rainsberger)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#productivity #work habits #software design\n\nA well-balanced programmer feels comfortable dealing with designing software\, managing projects\, and working with people. Companies seem to want to hire "the best"\, but well-balanced programmers relatively rare. Although many programmers feel confident arguing about algorithms\, modularity\, and scalability in design sessions\, they would stand out from their peers if they also had incredible habits for managing their work\, knew how to negotiate features with product owners\, had intelligent conversations with project managers about the risks in their project\, and understood what lies behind the irrationality of the people and systems around them. Sadly\, most programmers don't appreciate the value of these skills. Others don't know how to get started learning them. I started programming computers because people are messy! I'd like to share a curated collection of concepts for you explore that will help you become irresistibly valuable to your employer or clients. I plan to share the design principles and programming techniques that amplified my skills the most over the last 20 years. In addition\, I'll describe how I learned the key non-programming concepts\, techniques\, and approaches that have endeared me to fellow programmers\, managers\, and clients. I offer you a very practical approach to issues like influencing peers\, negotiating with stakeholders\, and adopting new ways of working safely. I'll help you start to build a personal work system that will free your mind to do your best work. I know how this might sound. I promise to share concrete techniques that you can begin applying right away. Of course\, these techniques aren't magic\, so you'll have to read some more and practise on your own\, but you will know how to get started right away on becoming the well-balanced programmer that every manager and co-worker will love to have on their team.

SUMMARY:Integration Testing with Docker and Testcontainers (Sergei Egorov)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#docker #testing #java demo\n\nUnit testing is fine\, but without proper integration testing\, especially if you work with external resources like databases and other services\, you might not know how your application will actually behave once it has been deployed to the real production environment. Testcontainers is a popular JVM testing library that provides lightweight\, throwaway instances of common databases\, Selenium web browsers\, or anything else that can run in a Docker container. In this talk\, we will briefly go throught the past\, present and the future of the library.

SUMMARY:Scaling Yourself (Scott Hanselman)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity 
DESCRIPTION:#closing keynote #productivity #career advice\n\nAs information workers\, we are asked to absorb even more information than ever before. More blogs\, more documentation\, more patterns\, more layers of abstraction. Now Twitter and Facebook compete with Email and Texts for our attention\, keeping us up-to-date on our friends dietary details and movie attendance second-by-second. Does all this information take a toll on your psyche or sharpen the saw? Is it a matter of finding the right tools and filters to capture what you need\, or do you just need to unplug.
