                        "description": "Ask somebody in the building industry to visually communicate the architecture of a building and you'll be presented with site plans, floor plans, elevation views, cross-section views and detail drawings. In contrast, ask a software developer to communicate the software architecture of a software system using diagrams and you'll likely get a confused mess of boxes and lines. I've asked thousands of software developers to do just this over the past decade and continue to do so today. The results from these software architecture sketching workshops still surprise me, anecdotally suggesting that effective visual communication of software architecture is a skill that's sorely lacking in the software development industry. Of course, as an industry, we do have the Unified Modeling Language (UML), but asking whether this provides an effective way to communicate software architecture is often irrelevant because many teams have already thrown out UML in favour of much simpler boxes and lines diagrams. Abandoning UML is one thing but, perhaps in the race for agility, many software development teams have lost the ability to communicate visually. This talk explores the visual communication of software architecture based upon my experience of working with software development teams across the globe. We'll look at what is commonplace today, the importance of creating a shared vocabulary, diagram notation, the value of creating a model plus how to use tooling and static analysis techniques to automate diagram generation.",

You'll learn to identify the code that really matters for your ability to maintain a codebase, how to prioritize improvements and even evaluate your architecture based on how you actually work with the code. We'll also cover the people side of programming as you learn to mine social information such as communication paths, developer knowledge and hotspots. All techniques are based on software evolution. They use data from the most underused informational source that we have in our industry: our version-control system. Each point is illustrated with a case study from a well-known codebase like Roslyn, ASP.NET MVC, Scala or Clojure. This is a new perspective on software development that will change how you work with large systems. Come join the hunt for better code!",

We will kick off with some considerations why you need queues in distributed systems and what their limitations are — in particular the at-least-once and at-most-once decision. And we consider when a queue is adding more complexity than it is worth. Next we discuss specific use cases. * Taking a look at ActiveMQ for starters, but also considering Kafka, Amazon SQS, and RabbitMQ. * Then we dive into Hazelcast — which seems to do everything, but might still not be perfect for everyone. * Finally we discuss Disque (kind of the brother of Redis), which is currently only a release candidate, but there are already production experiences.",

Looking at the code from the usage perspective (by first writing an acceptance test) allows us to focus on usability rather than concrete implementation. Unfortunately usually we rest on laurels not trying to uplift this practice into architecture level. Consumer driven contracts are like TDD applied to API. It’s especially important in the world of microservices. Most people do not take into consideration plenty of potential obstacles that should be tackled when dealing with REST / Messaging communication. Then instead of frequent, fully automated deploys via delivery pipeline, you might end up in an asylum due to frequent mental breakdowns caused by production disasters. I'll show you a CDC implementation called Spring Cloud Contract Verifier. This presentation will depict how you can use the Stub Runner functionality in order to have a fully automated solution to stub your HTTP / Messaging collaborators. Just by adding proper configuration you'll be able to have all of your microservice's surrounding world faked with stubs that were tested against their producer. We'll write a system using the CDC approach together with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. I'll show you how easy it is to write applications that have consumer driven API and that will allow a developer to speed up the time of writing his better quality software.",

                        "description": "Vault is a free and open source tool that took the security industry by surprise in 2015. Due to its innovative architecture, Vault is highly scalable and operationally secure. In addition to behaving like an encrypted key-value store (like encrypted Redis with ACLs), Vault's dynamic secret backends are capable of generating database login credentials, Amazon IAM users, and even certificates! Vault handles leasing, key revocation, key rolling, and auditing. This talk will not only discuss the underlying architecture of Vault, but also includes an interactive live demo of the most common features in Vault. Some topics include: Initializing a Vault, understanding secrets and leases, mounting and configuring secret backends with Vault, configuring and parsing audit backends with Vault.",

We tried to beat the threat of native development and  we got lured into thinking our great hardware and connectivity allows us to not worry about performance. We made the web slow and annoying as it was seemingly impossible to beat native apps with open web technologies. Latest changes in the market and a new set of web technologies allows us now to slim down and deliver experiences for our users native environments can not match. In this talk Chris Heilmann of Microsoft shows you how you can be part of this takeover and what it means for our already existing projects.",

Reactively composing streams of data, virtual time, marble diagrams and event-driven programming - where most of our code is pretty much just transferring data from database to presentation layer. During this live coding session for Rx beginners and intermediates there will not be a single slide, we start with empty IDE to step-by-step implement key constructs in RxJava. Most importantly we will discover how this high-level abstraction can help in existing projects. When to use RxJava, what problems does it solve and when using it is an excess of form over substance. We will learn how to build highly reliable and concurrent applications, improve throughput and resource utilization without hurting readability and avoiding complexity.",
