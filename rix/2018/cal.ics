SUMMARY:Surviving Legacy Code (J.B. Rainsberger)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity 
DESCRIPTION:#evolutionary design #legacy code #clean code\n\nWHAT YOU’LL LEARN:\n * When to refactor and when to rewrite\, and how to do that safely.\n * The killer technique for exposing in glorious detail exactly where the code wants us to break it apart.\n * How to use statistical sampling and logs to cobble together the beginnings of a test suite.\n * How to sterilise a legacy environment before even trying to change the code.\n * How to crack the chicken-and-egg problem: I need to write tests in order to refactor\, and I need to refactor in order to write tests.\n\n\n\nWe will work in short sessions on a diabolical-but-fun code base (available in at least 20 programming languages)\, practise micro-committing\, a key technique to changing difficult code safely\, practise a handful of refactoring and testing exercises that develop the most essential legacy code rescue skills and disciplines.

SUMMARY:Secure by Design – the Architect’s Guide to Security Design Principles (Eoin Woods)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#key principles #best practices #architecture\n\nSecurity is an ever more important topic for system designers. As our world becomes digital\, today’s safely-hidden back office system is tomorrow’s public API\, open to anyone on the Internet with a hacking tool and time on their hands. So the days of hoping that security is someone else’s problem are over. The security community has developed a well understood set of principles used to build systems that are secure (or at least securable) by design\, but this topic often isn’t included in the training of software developers\, assuming that it’s only relevant to security specialists. In this talk\, we will briefly discuss why security needs to be addressed as part of architecture work and then introduce a set of proven principles for the architecture of secure systems\, explaining each in the context of mainstream system design\, rather than in the specialised language of security engineering. Our technical examples will be Java centric\, but the principles are equally applicable to other technology stacks.

SUMMARY:Functional Design Patterns (Scott Wlaschin)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#design patterns #functional programming #deep dive\n\nIn object-oriented development\, we are all familiar with design patterns such as the Strategy pattern and Decorator pattern\, and design principles such as SOLID. The functional programming community has design patterns and principles as well. This talk will provide an overview of some of these patterns (such as currying\, monads)\, and present some demonstrations of FP design in practice. We'll also look at some of the ways you can use these patterns as part of a domain driven design process\, with some simple real world examples in F#. No jargon\, no maths\, and no prior F# experience necessary.

SUMMARY:Kotlin in Real Projects: Pragmatic Opinion on Pragmatic Language (Anton Keks)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#real experience #pros and cons\n\nKotlin is a marvelous JVM language that many have waited for. While we already have Java 8 and some people have migrated away from JVM while waiting for a more productive language\, Kotlin finally is here\, promising lots of good stuff\, but still allowing us to use the cross-platform and highly optimized JVM and many of familiar frameworks. However\, nothing comes without drawbacks. There have been some controversial decisions while designing the language that affect what is convenient to do in the language and what is not so. Moreover\, Kotlin is yet to deliver many of its promises\, like compilation speed. In this talk I'll talk about real life experience of using Kotlin in an Agile way\, the obstacles that you may encounter and how to overcome them.

DESCRIPTION:#productivity #getting things done\n\nThere are huge amount of different techniques and methodologies of self-organisation and personal effectiveness. However\, most of them are flawed\, because they do not take into account that the world is unpredictable\, people are different and “knowing how to be effective” and “being affective” are not quite the same thing. In this talk\, Maxim will show not “yet another personal effectiveness methodology” but the methodology that may help you to build your own one. Be ready to become more productive after this talk!

SUMMARY:Real World REST and Hands-On Hypermedia (Dylan Beattie)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#api design #best practices #csharp examples\n\nSo you've built your HTTP API\, and now that it's live\, you're suddenly dealing with a whole new set of problems. Do you really need to PUT the entire Customer just to change someone's email address? Why does it take you 25 API calls just to render a shopping cart? How do you find the bottlenecks when just drawing a web page requires fifty HTTP requests? What happens when one of your API consumers accidentally tries to GET your entire customer database? Most of us are familiar with the architectural style known as REST\, but even experienced developers often find it difficult to translate REST's architectural principles into running code. In this talk\, we'll explore the elements of REST related to hypermedia and the principle of "hypermedia as the engine of application state" (HATEOAS) - we'll talk about why they matter\, and when you might want to implement them in your own systems. We'll look at some of the tools that exist to help you design\, deliver and debug your HTTP APIs\, and we'll do some hands-on coding to show you what these patterns look like in a .NET web application using the HAL hypermedia application language.

SUMMARY:The Secret Sauce of Successful Teams (Sven Peters)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#leadership #teamwork #tips & tricks\n\nEvery software team writes code\, but some teams produce fewer bugs than others. Every software team creates new features\, but some teams develop features users love and others don't. What do high performance teams do differently\, and why are team members more focused\, satisfied and relaxed? They truly work together. No 10x programmer can achieve what a well rounded\, enthusiastic team can. Sven Peters\, Technical Evangelist\, will examine how the best software teams set and follow goals\, integrate new members fast\, ensure diversity\, monitor and continually improve team health\, embrace transparency\, use a playbook to guide them through every phase of development and much more! He shares techniques including: bugfix rotations\, OKRs\, feature buddies\, open demos\, focus days\, sanity checks and many more that help teams and team members to work more effectively together\, and produce awesome results.

SUMMARY:Making Your Tests Rock in Just 45 Minutes (Jakub Nabrdalik)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#tdd #bdd #java examples\n\nI’ve been using TDD/BDD at work for the last 12 years\, I also teach and mentor teams on this subject. I’ve found that misconceptions and errors in this field are shared\, and that most of us make the same mistakes. Give me 45 minutes of your time\, and I’ll try to address the most common problems\, hoping to improve your TDD/BDD situation as much as possible. I’ll try to solve: long running tests problem\, by bringing back the correct shape of test-pyramid with power of Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) with practical examples in Spring\, miscommunication and lost art of requirement gathering\, by focusing on readability\, introducing just enough of Domain Specific Language\, and sorting out what is important with the power of Spock\, difficult test setup and environment requirements\, by using command and conquer\, modularity\, monitoring\, mock abuse\, by showing what are the benefits of in-memory implementations\, and hopefully more. Most teams that do not write tests first do it\, because it’s hard for them. I’ll try to show you\, how to make it easy. Real life examples included. If you are not using TDD/BDD\, this might also interest you - you’ll know how to start the right way.

SUMMARY:The Pillars of Domain-Driven Design (Marco Heimeshoff)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#architecture #domain modeling #ddd\n\nDomain Driven Design is neither a method nor a technology\, it is a culture\, a way of thinking about the needs of the customers first and putting an emphasis on their language and human interactions. The promise of DDD is to tackle complexity in the heart of software\, and the means are plentiful and can be overwhelming. There are three pillars though\, on which the whole approach stands. A focus on learning\, language and empathy. With the right mindset it becomes simple to derive good models\, keep them pure and aligned with the business. Simple is not easy\, but done right Domain Driven Design transforms everything in your organisation from code to culture\, from agile to architecture.

SUMMARY:The Economics of Software Design (J.B. Rainsberger)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#code quality #refactoring #evolutionary design\n\nEvery month\, someone new asks me the question\, "How do I convince my manager to let me refactor?" While it's true that a manager shouldn't constrain the programmer's plans to deliver high-quality code\, the fact remains that some organisations allow their managers to assert this level of micro-control. In this talk I outline a set of models for justifying evolutionary design with basic economic concepts that relate directly to delivering\, planning\, and funding software projects. This talk will provide you with a solid argument to meet any skeptic's rational objections to writing tests first and letting both low-level design and architecture emerge.

SUMMARY:Elixir — Easy Fun for Busy Developers (David Schmitz)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#live coding #new language #distributed systems\n\nDid you ever want to create an application that is never down? Have you ever been jealous of those Erlang guys\, that produce applications that practically never fail? Have you tried Erlang and fled because of its baroque syntax and tooling? Enter Elixir! Elixir combines Ruby's love for programmers with the absolute power that is the Erlang platform. This talk will introduce programmers to Elixir and OTP. You will gain an understanding of what Elixir brings to the table and how to build highly scale-able systems with a toolset that is actually fun to use. Even if you will never use Elixir and OTP for you projects\, you will learn some of the concepts\, that make Erlang into such a powerful ecosystem.

SUMMARY:Client-side Machine Learning (Nikhila Ravi)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#machine learning #deep learning #node.js\n\nMachine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence are becoming ubiquitous in websites\, chatbots and mobile apps. While Node.js may not be the language of choice for building and training ML models\, it is an excellent option for building the user-facing server layer that brings ML product to life. In this talk you'll learn about the ways that Node and ML can work together\, whether it’s through running ML models in the browser (using WebAssembly and WebGPU) or writing a node server for an ML chatbot.

SUMMARY:Designing for Performance (Martin Thompson)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#low-latency #high performance #best practices\n\nWhat does it really mean to design software for high-performance? Performance is such a generic and misunderstood subject. In this talk the subject of software performance will be explored. We will focus on what is means to achieve sufficient response times\, throughput\, and scalability. Once the theory is out of the way we will dig into how modern hardware works and what we need to know about abstractions mapping to our software designs. These abstractions are the key to the models our code represents. The author has not meet many abstraction layers he did not enjoyed violating. There is a good reason for this. So many of our abstractions are leaky or just plain wrong.

SUMMARY:Mixed Reality Development and Best Practices (René Schulte )
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#hololens #mixed reality #ai\n\nThe year 2018 is the year of Mixed Reality with devices like the Microsoft HoloLens which are turning science fiction movie technology into reality. It’s an amazing time to be a developer and to be part of the fourth industrial revolution where XR is dramatically changing work processes. Rene will demonstrate some of the HoloLens projects he and his team worked on since 2015 and share how they were able to overcome challenges. His best practices and recommendations will help you avoid pit falls and might provide inspiration for your next XR projects. He will also provide you with a future perspective of Mixed Reality combining AI + MR using Windows Machine Learning in Unity.

SUMMARY:Deploying & Managing Microservices with Containers and Kubernetes (Ray Tsang)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#docker #devops #live demo\n\nA quick overview on Docker containers\, usages\, and how to scale up from a single container to a fleet of containers working together with Kubernetes for real-life workloads\, such as running java-based applications! Join this session to see how to use Kubernetes to launch\, manage\, and rolling-upgrade a fleet of Java application instances with session replication. Kubernetes builds on top of Docker to construct a clustered container scheduling service. Kubernetes enables users to ask a cluster to run a set of containers. The system will automatically pick worker nodes to run those containers on\, which we think of more as “scheduling” than “orchestration”. Kubernetes also provides ways for containers to find and communicate with each other and ways to manage both tightly coupled and loosely coupled sets of cooperating containers. In this session\, you’ll learn: how to containerize different Java-based microservice workloads using Docker and different build tool plugins\, deploying and managing a fleet of Java-based microservices in Kubernetes\, service discovery 101 in Kubernetes\, how to perform critical DevOps steps\, such as canary\, rolling update\, roll backs\, and some tips and tricks!

SUMMARY:Don't Walk Away from Complexity\, Run! (Venkat Subramaniam)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity 
DESCRIPTION:#closing keynote #simple design #best practices\n\nComplexity hurts. We find it everywhere\, in our daily lives\, in products\, and in the code we have to maintain as developers. Complexity comes in different forms and flavors. The ways in which complexity can manifest is\, well\, complex. In this keynote\, an award winning author and software practitioner will share experiences and observations from working on multiple software projects\, about what leads to complexities\, the traps developers and organizations fall into\, and what we can do to effectively deal with these common\, recurring issues we see across domains and products.
