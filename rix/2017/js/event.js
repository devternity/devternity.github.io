And all too often architecture is seen as a separate concern from development process, whereas the two are intertwined — what you build is influenced by how you build it, and vice versa. This course looks at the relationship between Agile processes and good architecture, taking in development process models, architectural styles, requirements techniques, sufficient modelling techniques, design patterns and testing practices.

Many patterns for implementing resilience into an application exist. The daunting questions are how to slice (design) an application and which patterns to pick and combine in order to match your specific needs best.</p><p>This workshop will address those questions in three parts:<ul><li>In the first part you will learn about the challenges how to design applications in a resilient way, get an overview about the resilience pattern landscape, learn some of the most important patterns and when to apply them.</li><li>In the second part you will have the opportunity to apply the just learned contents to a real-life case study and design and discuss your own resilient solution.</li><li>In the last part we will complete the workshop with a peek in some complementing topics, like some advanced patterns, a resilient design cycle and how to introduce the topic into the software development process.</li></ul></p><p>After this workshop, you will have a much deeper understanding how to design a solution that satisfies your specific robustness needs.</p>",

                      "description": "Tools like Docker and rkt make it easier than ever to package and distribute applications. Unfortunately, not all organizations have the luxury of being able to package their applications in a container runtime. Many organizations have virtualized workloads that cannot be easily containerized, such as applications that require full hardware isolation or virtual appliances. On the opposite end of the spectrum, some organizations deploy workloads that are already static binaries such as Go applications or Java applications that only rely on the JVM. These types of applications do not benefit from containerization as they are already self-contained. To address the growing heterogeneity of workloads, HashiCorp created Nomad – a globally aware, distributed scheduler and cluster manager. Nomad is designed to handle many types of workloads, on a variety of operating systems, at massive scale. Nomad empowers developers to specify jobs and tasks using a high-level specification in a plain-text file. Nomad accepts the job specification, parses the information, determines which compatible hosts have available resources, and then automatically manages the placement, healing, and scaling of the application. By placing multiple applications per host, Nomad maximizes resource utilization and dramatically reduces infrastructure costs. The flexibility of Nomad’s design brings the benefits of a scheduled application workflow to organizations with heterogeneous workloads and operating systems. This talk will discuss the pros and cons of running in a scheduled environment and includes a series of live demos to supplement the learning experience.",

Key misunderstandings around what do I test, what is a unit test, and what is the 'public interface' have led to test suites that are brittle, hard to read, and do not support easy refactoring. In this talk we re-discover Kent's original proposition, discover where key misunderstandings occured and look at a better approach to TDD that supports sofware development instead of impeding it.

As long as using single GPU server, you have to wait for hours or days to get the result of your work. This doesn't scale for production service, so you need a Distributed Training on the cloud eventually. Google has been building infrastructure for training the large scale neural network on the cloud for years, and now started to share the technology with external developers. In this session, we will introduce new pre-trained ML services such as Cloud Vision API and Speech API that works without any training. Also, we will look how TensorFlow and Cloud Machine Learning will accelerate custom model training for 10x - 40x with Google's distributed training infrastructure.",

Is that the scope you most often see? Probably not. Somehow Java devs became crazy communists-capitalists, recognising only private and public access, and preferring public everywhere. And so our projects look like a lawn right after snow melts: full of shit laying in public. Hard to put into your head. Hard to reason about. Entanglement instead of encapsulation. People even register every possible class in an IoC container, because FU (nctional) programming, that's why. You wanna find something in my code? Google it. Or how about inheritance? James Gosling asked in 2001 about what he would do differently if he had a chance to recreate Java, said he would probably remove class inheritance. We are in 2016, having lambdas, defaults on interfaces, AOP and other tricks, but young developers still prefer to just add another abstract class to your code. Gonna be fun navigating those seven layers of hell when you read it. Ok, maybe it's not THAT bad, but it's not much better either. The problem of course, is that we all start with tutorials, which cut corners for brevity. And we don't pay attention to those small problems till they hit us hard. Let's see how we can make our situation a little bit better, using Domain Driven Design, package-private scope, sensible packaging structure, and CQRS on microservices. Because it is actually easier, than not doing it. Real life project examples included.",

                      "description": "In this session we will look at how you can develop applications using AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, create a deployment pipeline and monitor your applications written on those two platforms. We will go through real examples of how they are used and share the experience of working with the two technologies in production. The talk will be supported with live demos with tips on setting up a continuous deployment pipeline and working with both technologies.",

I came to several counter-intuitive conclusions: – we're often late because we're trying to save time. - we're uncertain about some things, because we have too much information. - we're too slow, because we try to do them faster. During my talk I'm going to illustrate this in more details and show how it can be explained from the point of view of modern cognitive science as well as ancient wisdom. And of course the way to become more productive will be shown.",

It's a complex system made up of a number of components, many of which are open-sourced under the Moby Project umbrella. This talk looks in detail at one of these components, LinuxKit, which is an open-source toolkit for building custom, minimal, and immutable Linux distributions.  Docker uses LinuxKit to create the minimal host OS (a container OS) which ships as part of the Docker Desktop editions — in active use by developers all over the world. We will go through how LinuxKit is put together and demo how to use it to build your own, customised container OS within minutes — without compromising on security or usability.  This talk will also cover announcements made at DockerCon and how LinuxKit enabled those features and integrations.",

If all goes according to (the new) plan, the final version of the list will see the light of day a few days before the conference.
