                "description": "Software architecture and coding are often seen as mutually exclusive disciplines, despite us referring to higher level abstractions when we talk about our software. You've probably heard others on your team talking about components, services and layers rather than objects when they're having discussions. Take a look at the codebase though. Can you clearly see these abstractions or does the code reflect some other structure? If so, why is there no clear mapping between the architecture and the code? Why do those architecture diagrams that you have on the wall say one thing whereas your code says another? In fact, why is it so hard to automatically generate a decent architecture diagram from an existing codebase? Join us to explore this topic further.",

A strong coding culture gives the power back to the developer to concentrate on one thing: Create awesome stuff! Imagine a culture where the input of the whole organization turns an individual idea into a user story in just a couple of hours; where everybody's goal is to make the customer awesome, and where you work on stuff you love instead stuff you loathe. A great coding culture concentrates on making developers productive and happy by removing unnecessary overhead, bringing autonomous teams together, helping the individual programmer to innovate, and raising the awareness among the developers to create better code. I will talk about how to establish and foster a strong engineering-focused culture that scales from a small team to a huge organization with hundreds of developers. I'll give lots of examples from our experience at Atlassian to show that once you're working in a great coding culture, you won't want to work anywhere else.",

The same approach is now available in the AWS cloud. We demonstrate how to use Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) to create machine learning models, deploy them to production, and obtain predictions in real-time. We then demonstrate how to build a complete smart application using Amazon ML, Amazon Kinesis, and AWS Lambda. We walk you through the process flow and architecture, demonstrate outcomes, and then dive into the implementation. In this session, you learn how to use Amazon ML as well as how to integrate Amazon ML into your applications to take advantage of predictive analysis in the cloud.",

Rarely can you hear about the chalenges and issues related to this architectural approach and we’ll tell nothing but the truth about it. Also we’ll show how you can quickly start creating your own apps using the tools we have created at 4finance / SoftwareMill. Just a glimpse of what will you see in action: zookeeper for service discovery; Kibana / Graphana for monitoring; client code in Java, Scala and Groovy; Ansible for provisioning. And the best part is that everything is opensourced and ready to use. Expect nothing but live coding and may the Demo Gods have mercy on us ;-)",

In this talk I will review the different models: asynchronous vs. synchronous distributed systems; message passing vs shared memory communication; failure detectors and leader election problems; consensus and different kind of replication. I will also review a series of books on distributed systems in order to recommend the best one according to the topics we would like to learn about, or the problems we would like to solve.

During coding session you as a programmer tends to make so many decision that sometimes force you to neglect 'unimportant details' that might sounds like specific use cases, unclear statements or somethings that won't gonna happen. In most cases the system even so complex that is not that easy to step out and see the whole picture, even from user's point of view. Historically software developers used to trust other people called testers to verify those 'details' from user's perspective before deploying into production. In order to have proper alignment inside the team dedicated 'QA step' added to the process. That obvious solution have some quick-wins with outcome of found bugs before releasing the software. But there are some tradeoffs, such as: slower delivery cycle, extra test documentation and GUI automated tests that are not that easy to maintain.

Somehow the confidence, speed and simplicity you need isn't there, and it feels like a battle just to keep your builds green and your team in sync, let alone reap benefits beyond. Let's fix that. In this talk you'll learn to spot, solve and encourage improvements around the most frequent build smells we see in dev team's practices, setup and goals. Let's get to the real benefits of continuous integration and delivery, build real confidence and speed, and lose the pain.",

                "description": "Analytics has always been a cornerstone of business, providing vital information about how the business is performing. The downside however is that analytics traditionally has moved at the speed of business - that is to say glacially. The technologies have been famously positioned as outliers in the greater IT scene, with hard-to-use products for creating reports and languages that are specialities within their fields. With the advent of new analytical technologies like Hadoop, Spark and Kafka however that is changing. Agile methodologies have creeped in to the analysts’ desks and have created the opportunity to gain insights in a faster pace. The session describes how we can apply tools that have made software development truly rapid to the domain of analytics. By incorporating these methods and tools we can increase the pace of returns and focus on what is important - insight.",

While the benefits brought by this style of SOA to our productivity and reliability are clear, the architecture required some non-obvious changes in the way we operate systems, and a way to tackle the overhead associated with having hundreds of small moving parts to serve every request. In this talk we’ll share the toolkit and strategy SoundCloud uses to keep its micro-services explosion manageable. What do we do about the operations overhead? How to spread devops skills across teams to support the “you build it, you run it” vision? How to deal with breaking changes and asynchronous behaviours? How to deal with chatty interactions? Which protocol? How do I even get a diagram telling me how all this stuff is put together? ",

Due to years of things like implementing ESB where it’s not needed, programming with EJB, where it brings only tears and blood, our industry has build a distrust for Ph.D., ex-cathedra, design by committee and generally any theory not tested in reality. We have learned to make small steps, proof-of-concepts, spikes, proper research. Yet, even with small steps, TDD and the like, the architecture we design backfires months later in unpredictable ways. That happens quite often because architects disregard the organization’s structure and culture completely. Melvin Conway described why communication structures eat your architecture for breakfast, as early as 1968. Since then, many have noticed, that the culture your company has, eats both architecture and structure even before breakfast. Clearly, you cannot think about architecture, without taking both into account. In this talk we’ll look at some architecture decisions, and how nice design brakes due to structure and culture of the organization. We already have developers and operations cooperating as DevOps. Perhaps we need the same for architects and managers?",

Without resilience, nothing else matters. Most developers understand what the word resilience means, at least superficially, but way too many lack a deeper understanding of what it really means in the context of the system that they are working on now. I find it really sad to see, since understanding and managing failure is more important today than ever. Outages are incredibly costly—for many definitions of cost—and can sometimes take down whole businesses. In this talk we will explore the essence of resilience. What does it really mean? What is its mechanics and characterizing traits? How do other sciences and industries manage it, and what can we learn from that? We will see that everything hints at the same conclusion; that failure is inevitable and needs to be embraced, and that resilience is by design. ",
