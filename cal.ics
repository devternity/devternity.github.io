SUMMARY:Surviving Legacy Code (J.B. Rainsberger)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity 
DESCRIPTION:#evolutionary design #legacy code #clean code\n\nWHAT YOU’LL LEARN:\n * When to refactor and when to rewrite\, and how to do that safely.\n * The killer technique for exposing in glorious detail exactly where the code wants us to break it apart.\n * How to use statistical sampling and logs to cobble together the beginnings of a test suite.\n * How to sterilise a legacy environment before even trying to change the code.\n * How to crack the chicken-and-egg problem: I need to write tests in order to refactor\, and I need to refactor in order to write tests.\n\n\n\nWe will work in short sessions on a diabolical-but-fun code base (available in at least 20 programming languages)\, practise micro-committing\, a key technique to changing difficult code safely\, practise a handful of refactoring and testing exercises that develop the most essential legacy code rescue skills and disciplines.

SUMMARY:Secure by Design – the Architect’s Guide to Security Design Principles (Eoin Woods)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#key principles #best practices #architecture\n\nSecurity is an ever more important topic for system designers. As our world becomes digital\, today’s safely-hidden back office system is tomorrow’s public API\, open to anyone on the Internet with a hacking tool and time on their hands. So the days of hoping that security is someone else’s problem are over. The security community has developed a well understood set of principles used to build systems that are secure (or at least securable) by design\, but this topic often isn’t included in the training of software developers\, assuming that it’s only relevant to security specialists. In this talk\, we will briefly discuss why security needs to be addressed as part of architecture work and then introduce a set of proven principles for the architecture of secure systems\, explaining each in the context of mainstream system design\, rather than in the specialised language of security engineering. Our technical examples will be Java centric\, but the principles are equally applicable to other technology stacks.

SUMMARY:Serverless in Production (Yan Cui)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#best practices #experience report #aws lambda\n\nIn this talk Yan Cui shares his experience of migrating an existing monolithic architecture for a social network to AWS Lambda\, and how it empowered a small team to deliver features quickly and how they address operational concerns such as CI/CD\, logging\, monitoring and config management. This sessions draws on my experience leading a team that transformed our entire architecture in under 6 months\, where we also managed to cut cost by over 90%\, and increased production deployments from 4-6 per month to 80-100 per month. We did that whilst coming up with solutions to those common operational concerns to ensure we not only run a serverless architecture in production\, but we do so responsibly. The audience should have basic understanding of how AWS Lambda works\, and are aware of some popular AWS services like DynamoDB\, Kinesis\, S3. I’m the best person to speak on the subject as I lead the team on this migration and were responsible for large parts of the actual implementation\, and as the architect I was also responsible for our entire architecture (and the first one to be woken up at night if things go wrong!). I have written extensively on the operational aspect of working with AWS Lambda\, and my work has been regularly referenced by the AWS Lambda team including talks at re:invent\, as well as the new Serverless Well Architected whitepaper.

SUMMARY:Functional Design Patterns (Scott Wlaschin)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#design patterns #functional programming #deep dive\n\nIn object-oriented development\, we are all familiar with design patterns such as the Strategy pattern and Decorator pattern\, and design principles such as SOLID. The functional programming community has design patterns and principles as well. This talk will provide an overview of some of these patterns (such as currying\, monads)\, and present some demonstrations of FP design in practice. We'll also look at some of the ways you can use these patterns as part of a domain driven design process\, with some simple real world examples in F#. No jargon\, no maths\, and no prior F# experience necessary.

SUMMARY:Kotlin in Real Projects: Pragmatic Opinion on Pragmatic Language (Anton Keks)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#real experience #pros and cons\n\nKotlin is a marvelous JVM language that many have waited for. While we already have Java 8 and some people have migrated away from JVM while waiting for a more productive language\, Kotlin finally is here\, promising lots of good stuff\, but still allowing us to use the cross-platform and highly optimized JVM and many of familiar frameworks. However\, nothing comes without drawbacks. There have been some controversial decisions while designing the language that affect what is convenient to do in the language and what is not so. Moreover\, Kotlin is yet to deliver many of its promises\, like compilation speed. In this talk I'll talk about real life experience of using Kotlin in an Agile way\, the obstacles that you may encounter and how to overcome them.

LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#productivity #getting things done\n\nThere are huge amount of different techniques and methodologies of self-organisation and personal effectiveness. However\, most of them are flawed\, because they do not take into account that the world is unpredictable\, people are different and “knowing how to be effective” and “being affective” are not quite the same thing. In this talk\, Maxim will show not “yet another personal effectiveness methodology” but the methodology that may help you to build your own one. Be ready to become more productive after this talk!

SUMMARY:Real World REST and Hands-On Hypermedia (Dylan Beattie)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#api design #best practices #csharp examples\n\nSo you've built your HTTP API\, and now that it's live\, you're suddenly dealing with a whole new set of problems. Do you really need to PUT the entire Customer just to change someone's email address? Why does it take you 25 API calls just to render a shopping cart? How do you find the bottlenecks when just drawing a web page requires fifty HTTP requests? What happens when one of your API consumers accidentally tries to GET your entire customer database? Most of us are familiar with the architectural style known as REST\, but even experienced developers often find it difficult to translate REST's architectural principles into running code. In this talk\, we'll explore the elements of REST related to hypermedia and the principle of "hypermedia as the engine of application state" (HATEOAS) - we'll talk about why they matter\, and when you might want to implement them in your own systems. We'll look at some of the tools that exist to help you design\, deliver and debug your HTTP APIs\, and we'll do some hands-on coding to show you what these patterns look like in a .NET web application using the HAL hypermedia application language.

LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#leadership #teamwork #tips & tricks\n\nEvery software team writes code\, but some teams produce fewer bugs than others. Every software team creates new features\, but some teams develop features users love and others don't. What do high performance teams do differently\, and why are team members more focused\, satisfied and relaxed? They truly work together. No 10x programmer can achieve what a well rounded\, enthusiastic team can. Sven Peters\, Technical Evangelist\, will examine how the best software teams set and follow goals\, integrate new members fast\, ensure diversity\, monitor and continually improve team health\, embrace transparency\, use a playbook to guide them through every phase of development and much more! He shares techniques including: bugfix rotations\, OKRs\, feature buddies\, open demos\, focus days\, sanity checks and many more that help teams and team members to work more effectively together\, and produce awesome results.

SUMMARY:Making Your Tests Rock in Just 45 Minutes (Jakub Nabrdalik)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#tdd #bdd #java examples\n\nI’ve been using TDD/BDD at work for the last 12 years\, I also teach and mentor teams on this subject. I’ve found that misconceptions and errors in this field are shared\, and that most of us make the same mistakes. Give me 45 minutes of your time\, and I’ll try to address the most common problems\, hoping to improve your TDD/BDD situation as much as possible. I’ll try to solve: long running tests problem\, by bringing back the correct shape of test-pyramid with power of Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) with practical examples in Spring\, miscommunication and lost art of requirement gathering\, by focusing on readability\, introducing just enough of Domain Specific Language\, and sorting out what is important with the power of Spock\, difficult test setup and environment requirements\, by using command and conquer\, modularity\, monitoring\, mock abuse\, by showing what are the benefits of in-memory implementations\, and hopefully more. Most teams that do not write tests first do it\, because it’s hard for them. I’ll try to show you\, how to make it easy. Real life examples included. If you are not using TDD/BDD\, this might also interest you - you’ll know how to start the right way.

SUMMARY:The Pillars of Domain-Driven Design (Marco Heimeshoff)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#architecture #domain modeling #ddd\n\nDomain Driven Design is neither a method nor a technology\, it is a culture\, a way of thinking about the needs of the customers first and putting an emphasis on their language and human interactions. The promise of DDD is to tackle complexity in the heart of software\, and the means are plentiful and can be overwhelming. There are three pillars though\, on which the whole approach stands. A focus on learning\, language and empathy. With the right mindset it becomes simple to derive good models\, keep them pure and aligned with the business. Simple is not easy\, but done right Domain Driven Design transforms everything in your organisation from code to culture\, from agile to architecture.

SUMMARY:The Economics of Software Design (J.B. Rainsberger)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#code quality #refactoring #evolutionary design\n\nEvery month\, someone new asks me the question\, "How do I convince my manager to let me refactor?" While it's true that a manager shouldn't constrain the programmer's plans to deliver high-quality code\, the fact remains that some organisations allow their managers to assert this level of micro-control. In this talk I outline a set of models for justifying evolutionary design with basic economic concepts that relate directly to delivering\, planning\, and funding software projects. This talk will provide you with a solid argument to meet any skeptic's rational objections to writing tests first and letting both low-level design and architecture emerge.

SUMMARY:10 Tips for Failing Badly at Microservices (David Schmitz)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#architecture #anti-patterns #rant\n\nMicroservices are just a bunch hip new framework plus some AngularJS frontend or React\, right? So\, if you want to make sure that you absolutely and definitely fail at your Microservice project\, then watch this talk and learn how. Using real world experience from multiple green field and brown field projects\, I can show you how to ignore the mandatory organizational impact\, how to focus on the code only without any regard towards ops and testing\, why continuous deployment is for losers\, why jumping onto every new and untested framework is a must\, why event-sourcing and CQRS are both free lunches and now you can add complexity without any real need\, and more! \nIf you mind my tips\, then surely you will fail at Microservices and your boss will never again try to move away from your beloved vintage monolith.

SUMMARY:Understanding Venture Capital for Developers (Svetlana Bozhko)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#startups #soft skills #career\n\nThere is a vast difference between working in a corporate environment and a startup. Having worked closely with dozens of startups and doing tech due diligence\, Svetlana will share what can go wrong if you're working as a contractor for a startup — options\, equity\, shares\, vesting\, non-compete. You will get a set of heuristics for validating the feasibility of a startup\, learn to see red flags inside “the next big unicorn” and understand how to get your job agreement right. As a bonus\, you will learn the essential non-technical skills you will need to succeed with a tech startup and how to develop them.

SUMMARY:Designing for Performance (Martin Thompson)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#low-latency #high performance #best practices\n\nWhat does it really mean to design software for high-performance? Performance is such a generic and misunderstood subject. In this talk the subject of software performance will be explored. We will focus on what is means to achieve sufficient response times\, throughput\, and scalability. Once the theory is out of the way we will dig into how modern hardware works and what we need to know about abstractions mapping to our software designs. These abstractions are the key to the models our code represents. The author has not meet many abstraction layers he did not enjoyed violating. There is a good reason for this. So many of our abstractions are leaky or just plain wrong.

SUMMARY:Mixed Reality Development and Best Practices (René Schulte )
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#hololens #mixed reality #ai\n\nThe year 2018 is the year of Mixed Reality with devices like the Microsoft HoloLens which are turning science fiction movie technology into reality. It’s an amazing time to be a developer and to be part of the fourth industrial revolution where XR is dramatically changing work processes. Rene will demonstrate some of the HoloLens projects he and his team worked on since 2015 and share how they were able to overcome challenges. His best practices and recommendations will help you avoid pit falls and might provide inspiration for your next XR projects. He will also provide you with a future perspective of Mixed Reality combining AI + MR using Windows Machine Learning in Unity.

SUMMARY:Deploying & Managing Microservices with Containers and Kubernetes (Ray Tsang)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#docker #devops #live demo\n\nA quick overview on Docker containers\, usages\, and how to scale up from a single container to a fleet of containers working together with Kubernetes for real-life workloads\, such as running java-based applications! Join this session to see how to use Kubernetes to launch\, manage\, and rolling-upgrade a fleet of Java application instances with session replication. Kubernetes builds on top of Docker to construct a clustered container scheduling service. Kubernetes enables users to ask a cluster to run a set of containers. The system will automatically pick worker nodes to run those containers on\, which we think of more as “scheduling” than “orchestration”. Kubernetes also provides ways for containers to find and communicate with each other and ways to manage both tightly coupled and loosely coupled sets of cooperating containers. In this session\, you’ll learn: how to containerize different Java-based microservice workloads using Docker and different build tool plugins\, deploying and managing a fleet of Java-based microservices in Kubernetes\, service discovery 101 in Kubernetes\, how to perform critical DevOps steps\, such as canary\, rolling update\, roll backs\, and some tips and tricks!

SUMMARY:How We Built Dev.Tube (Eduards Sizovs)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity 
DESCRIPTION:#lean startup #architecture #case study\n\nBuilt by 2 developers in only 2 months\, Dev.Tube is gradually becoming the primary hub of developer videos. In this entertaining\, but practical session\, Eduards and Andrey will tell what went wrong\, what went well and what can we learn from Dev.Tube launch. We’ll cover: how we attracted 1 million monthly visitors? how we maintain infrastructure (and how much does it cost $$$)? why experienced java developers ended up writing javascript? why sometimes we do not write unit tests? how to make OSS contributors happy (or angry)? how SaaS vendors helped us survive the load (and why)? and much more! After this session\, you’ll be equipped with interesting real-world take-aways. Great mood guaranteed!
